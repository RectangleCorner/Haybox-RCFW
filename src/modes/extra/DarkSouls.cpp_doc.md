Based on the code snippet provided, it appears to be related to input and output handling in a game's control scheme, specifically for Dark Souls. Here are some possible files that may contain related information:

1. DarkSouls.hpp - This file is mentioned in the `#include` statement at the beginning of the code snippet. It's likely a header file that provides the class definition for the DarkSouls class.

2. InputState.hpp - This file is not explicitly mentioned in the code, but it's likely that there is another file that defines the InputState class, as it is used as a parameter in some function signatures.

3. OutputState.hpp - Similar to InputState.hpp, this file is not explicitly mentioned but is likely to exist, defining the OutputState class used in function signatures.

4. socd.hpp - This file is not shown in the code snippet, but the code mentions a namespace `socd::SocdType` and `socd::SocdPair`, so it's possible that there is a socd.hpp file with related definitions.

It's important to note that these are just educated guesses based on the provided code snippet. The actual file names and organization of the codebase may vary.
