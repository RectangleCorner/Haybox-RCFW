Based on the summary provided, it seems like this code defines a class called `DefaultKeyboardMode`. Here are some possible files that could be related:

1. `core/KeyboardMode.hpp`: This file could define the base `KeyboardMode` class that is being inherited by `DefaultKeyboardMode`.
2. `core/socd.hpp`: This file could define the `socd::SocdType` type used as a parameter in the constructor of `DefaultKeyboardMode`.
3. `core/state.hpp`: This file could define the `InputState` class used in the `UpdateKeys` function of `DefaultKeyboardMode`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
