Based on the given code snippet, it appears that the file `KeyboardMode.hpp` is defining a class called `KeyboardMode`. 

Here are my guesses for other related files based on the included headers:

1. `core/InputMode.hpp`: This file might contain the definition of the base class `InputMode`, from which `KeyboardMode` is derived.
2. `core/socd.hpp`: This file might define some utility functions or constants related to SOCD (Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Directions) handling.
3. `core/state.hpp`: This file might define some data structures or functions related to the state of the keyboard.

Please note that these are just guesses based on the provided information and the included headers. The actual file names and contents may vary.
