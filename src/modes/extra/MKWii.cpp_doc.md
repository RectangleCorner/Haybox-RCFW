Based on the code snippet provided, it appears to be a part of a larger codebase for modifying input and output states for a Wii console game. Here is a rough summary of the contents:

1. The code includes "modes/extra/MKWii.hpp" which could potentially include additional header files specific to the Mario Kart Wii game.

2. Several constants are defined, including analog stick minimum, neutral, and maximum values.

3. The constructor for the MKWii class is defined, which takes a "socd_type" parameter. It initializes certain variables like "_socd_pair_count" and "_socd_pairs" using dynamically allocated memory.

4. The "UpdateDigitalOutputs" function updates the digital output states based on the input state. It maps inputs like "b", "x", "z", "up", "a", and "start" to the corresponding outputs "a", "b", "triggerLDigital", "buttonR", "dpadUp", and "start".

5. The "UpdateAnalogOutputs" function updates the analog output states based on the input state. The logic includes checking for joystick and nunchuk inputs to set the appropriate output values. For example, if "z" is pressed, the "triggerLAnalog" output is set to 140. If the nunchuk is connected, the "leftStickX" and "leftStickY" outputs are set based on the nunchuk position.

Based on this information, it seems the code is related to mapping input states to output states for controlling gameplay in a Wii game, specifically Mario Kart Wii.
