It likely has functions to handle sending reports of input states and updating keys. It also includes other files such as "core/InputMode.hpp", "core/socd.hpp", "core/state.hpp", and "TUKeyboard.hpp".

Based on this information, the file "core/InputMode.hpp" may define the InputMode class being inherited from. The file "core/socd.hpp" may contain definitions related to the SOCD (Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Direction) attitude control. The file "core/state.hpp" may contain definitions related to the state of the program or system. Finally, "TUKeyboard.hpp" likely contains definitions and functions related to keyboard inputs.
