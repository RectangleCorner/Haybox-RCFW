Based on the provided code, it seems that the file is defining a class called "KeyboardMode" that inherits from "InputMode". 

Based on the mentioned headers, it is likely that the "KeyboardMode" class is responsible for capturing keyboard input and sending it as a report. 

To find more information, you may want to look into the following files:
1. "core/InputMode.hpp": This file may contain the definition of the base class "InputMode" from which "KeyboardMode" derives.
2. "core/socd.hpp": This file may have information about SOCD (Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions) handling.
3. "core/state.hpp": This file may define the "InputState" class or provide further context on its usage.
4. "keycodes.h": This file likely contains keycodes or mappings for keyboard input.

Reviewing these files should provide more details on the functionality and implementation of the "KeyboardMode" class.
