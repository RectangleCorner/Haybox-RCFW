Based on the provided summary and the included header files, here is what the files may contain:

1. InputSource.hpp:
   - Likely defines the interface for an input source.
   - May contain pure virtual functions that derived classes must implement.

2. state.hpp:
   - Possibly defines a data structure for storing the state of inputs.
   - May include member variables and functions related to input state management.

3. stdlib.hpp:
   - Likely includes standard library headers required for the code.

4. GpioButtonInput.hpp:
   - Defines a class named `GpioButtonInput` that is derived from `InputSource`.
   - Contains a struct `GpioButtonMapping` for mapping buttons to input states.
   - Declares a constructor for `GpioButtonInput` that takes an array of `GpioButtonMapping` objects and the number of buttons.
   - Declares a function `ScanSpeed()` that returns an `InputScanSpeed` (which is not defined in the provided code).
   - Declares a function `UpdateInputs()` that takes a reference to `InputState` and updates the inputs based on the GPIO buttons.
   - Defines protected member variables `_button_mappings` and `_button_count` to store the button mappings and count.

Note: As the implementation details are not provided, the actual content of these files may differ.
