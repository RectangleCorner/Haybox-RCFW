Based on the code snippet provided, it seems like the file "socd.hpp" is primarily focused on a feature called "second input priority" and various functions related to it. The file contains the following functions:

1. `void socd::second_input_priority_no_reactivation(bool &input_dir1, bool &input_dir2, SocdState &socd_state)`: This function implements the "second input priority" feature without reactivation. It takes two input direction boolean variables (`input_dir1` and `input_dir2`) and a reference to a `SocdState` object. It updates the values of the input direction variables based on the current state of the `socd_state` object.

2. `void socd::second_input_priority(bool &input_dir1, bool &input_dir2, SocdState &socd_state)`: This function implements the "second input priority" feature. It takes two input direction boolean variables (`input_dir1` and `input_dir2`) and a reference to a `SocdState` object. It updates the values of the input direction variables based on the current state of the `socd_state` object.

3. `void socd::neutral(bool &input_dir1, bool &input_dir2)`: This function sets both input direction boolean variables (`input_dir1` and `input_dir2`) to false if they are both true. It ensures that both inputs cannot be active simultaneously.

4. `void socd::dir1_priority(bool &input_dir1, bool &input_dir2)`: This function gives priority to the first input direction (`input_dir1`) over the second input direction (`input_dir2`). If both input directions are active, it sets `input_dir2` to false.

Based on this information, it appears that the file "socd.hpp" is related to handling input directions with a focus on prioritizing the second input and preventing conflicting inputs.
