The given code appears to be a part of a C++ file that defines a namespace "serial" and contains functions related to serial communication. Based on the function names and their parameters, it seems like this code is implementing a wrapper around the serial communication library to provide an interface for initializing, closing, printing, and writing to a serial connection.

Some possible related files could be:

1. `serial.hpp`: This file is most likely the header file that contains the declarations of the functions and any necessary constant definitions or includes.
2. `stdlib.hpp`: This file is possibly another header file and could contain additional standard library declarations or definitions that are used in the main code.
3. `Adafruit_TinyUSB.h`: This file, assuming it is available and included properly, is likely the header file for the Adafruit TinyUSB library, which may provide the API for serial communication on specific hardware.

To get a clearer understanding of the code and its overall usage, it would be helpful to have more context and additional code files.
