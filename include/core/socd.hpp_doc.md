This appears to be a header file named "core_socd.hpp". It contains declarations and definitions for functions related to "state.hpp" and "stdlib.hpp". 

The file defines a namespace "socd" with several typedefs and structs. The "SocdType" enum represents different types of SOC (Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal) directions. There are also two structs, "SocdPair" and "SocdState", which represent different states and configurations of SOC.

The file then declares several functions within the "socd" namespace. These functions include "second_input_priority_no_reactivation", "second_input_priority", "neutral", and "dir1_priority", each of which takes references to bool variables and a reference to a "SocdState" struct.

Overall, this file appears to define functions and structs related to handling SOC directions and states in a gaming or input control context.
