Based on the code snippet provided, it seems to be a part of a larger codebase for a program that handles input and output for controlling Super Smash Bros. 64. The file appears to define a class called "Smash64" that has functions for updating the digital and analog outputs based on the input state.

Possible files related to this code snippet could include:

1. "InputState.hpp" - A header file defining the "InputState" struct or class that holds the current input state of the controller.
2. "OutputState.hpp" - A header file defining the "OutputState" struct or class that holds the desired output state for controlling the game.
3. "socd.hpp" - A header file defining the "SocdType" and "SocdPair" structs or classes for handling Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Direction (SOCD) inputs.
4. "constants.hpp" - A header file defining constant values such as "ANALOG_STICK_MIN", "ANALOG_STICK_NEUTRAL", and "ANALOG_STICK_MAX".
5. Other source files or headers that may be included or referenced in the code snippet, such as "DirectionUtils.hpp" or other helper functions.

These are just educated guesses based on the provided code snippet, and the actual files may vary depending on the structure and organization of the larger codebase.
