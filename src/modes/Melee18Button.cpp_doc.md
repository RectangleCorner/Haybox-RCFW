Based on the code snippet, it appears to be a part of a larger project that involves handling inputs for the Super Smash Bros. Melee game. Here are some possible guesses for the other files in the project:

1. `InputState.hpp`: This file likely contains the definition of the `InputState` class or struct, which represents the current state of the input devices (e.g., buttons, analog sticks) for the game controller.

2. `OutputState.hpp`: This file probably defines the `OutputState` class or struct, which represents the desired output state for the game (e.g., button presses, analog stick positions).

3. `socd/SocdPair.hpp`: This file might belong to a subdirectory called `socd` and contains the definition of the `SocdPair` struct, which represents a pair of input states that need to be handled in a mutually exclusive manner (e.g., left and right inputs, down and up inputs) to prevent unintended actions in the game.

4. `InputMode.hpp`: This file may define the `InputMode` class or struct, which could be a base class that provides a set of methods for handling different input modes or configurations.

5. `Melee18ButtonOptions.hpp`: This file could define the `Melee18ButtonOptions` struct or class, which represents a set of options or settings for the `Melee18Button` class.

6. Other header or source files related to the project's framework or libraries, such as `stdio.h`, `iostream`, or `stdint.h`, if used.

It's important to note that these are just educated guesses based on the code snippet provided. The actual structure and contents of the project could be different.
