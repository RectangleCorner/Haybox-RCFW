Based on the summary of the file, it seems to be a mode class for fighting game control. It defines the behavior of the controller inputs and outputs for that particular mode. The class has two main functions: "UpdateDigitalOutputs" and "UpdateAnalogOutputs", which update the digital and analog outputs respectively based on the current inputs. Other parts of the code include the constructor, where the mode is initialized with specified SOCD types, and the definition of the SOCD pairs. 

Possible file names or related files could be:
- FgcMode.hpp (the current file itself)
- modes.hpp (header file that includes all mode classes)
- InputState.hpp (header file defining the input state structure)
- OutputState.hpp (header file defining the output state structure)
- socd.hpp (header file defining the SOCD pair structure and types)
- controller.hpp (header file defining the general controller behavior)
- main.cpp (implementation file where different modes are used and tested)
