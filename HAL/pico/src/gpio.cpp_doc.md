Based on the code snippet you provided, it seems that the relevant files might include:
1. "gpio.hpp": This file likely contains the declaration of the `gpio` namespace and the `init_pin` function.
2. "stdlib.hpp": This file probably includes some standard library functions that are used in the implementation of the `gpio` namespace.

It's important to note that these are just educated guesses based on the code snippet. The actual names and contents of the files may vary depending on the project structure and naming conventions.
