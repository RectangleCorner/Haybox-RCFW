Based on the file name and the content, it seems like this file is a header file for a class called "B0XXInputViewer" that is a subclass of "CommunicationBackend". The class has a constructor that takes an array of "InputSource" pointers and a size parameter. It also has a destructor. There is a function called "SendReport" that has no parameters and returns void.

The class has a private member variable called "_report" which is an array of 25 uint8_t elements, and another private member variable called "_clock" which is a uint8_t.

The file also includes a header file called "core/CommunicationBackend.hpp" and defines an enum called "reportState" which consists of four byte values: ReportOff, ReportOn, ReportEnd, and ReportInvalid.

Based on this information, it seems like this file is related to a communication backend for an input viewer, possibly for a B0XX device. The "SendReport" function suggests that this class is responsible for sending some kind of report or data.
