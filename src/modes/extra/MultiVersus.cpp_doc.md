This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger program that implements a class called MultiVersus. The class has functions for updating the digital and analog outputs based on input states.

Based on the provided snippet, it seems like this code is defining the behavior for mapping input states to output states for a gaming controller. It includes various mappings for buttons and analog sticks, and handles the use of modifiers to change the behavior of certain inputs.

Here's a brief summary of what each function does:

1. Constructor: Initializes a MultiVersus object and takes a socd_type parameter for configuring "Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Directions" (SOCd) behavior. It sets up an array of socd::SocdPair objects based on the input and socd_type.

2. UpdateDigitalOutputs: Maps digital input states to corresponding output states. It sets the outputs.x and outputs.y to inputs.x and inputs.y respectively. It also handles mapping inputs such as start, select, home, triggerL, triggerR, A, B, Z, buttonL, buttonR, dpadLeft, dpadRight, dpadDown, and dpadUp to their respective output states.

3. UpdateAnalogOutputs: Maps analog input states to corresponding output states. It uses the UpdateDirections function to calculate the coordinates of the left analog stick based on the input directions. It then sets the leftStickX and leftStickY outputs accordingly. It also handles setting the triggerLAnalog and triggerRAnalog outputs based on the triggerLDigital and triggerRDigital inputs respectively. Additionally, if a nunchuk is connected, it overrides the left analog stick outputs with the nunchuk's x and y values.

Based on this information, it seems like the MultiVersus class is responsible for handling the input-output mappings for a gaming controller, potentially for use in a multiplayer versus game. Additional context and code would be needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality.
