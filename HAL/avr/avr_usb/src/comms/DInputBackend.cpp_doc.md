Based on the code snippet provided, it seems like the following files may provide additional information:

1. `comms/DInputBackend.hpp`: This file likely contains the declaration and possibly the implementation of the `DInputBackend` class, which is responsible for handling input from DirectInput devices.

2. `core/CommunicationBackend.hpp`: This file likely contains the declaration of the `CommunicationBackend` class, which `DInputBackend` inherits from.

3. `core/state.hpp`: This file likely contains the declaration of the `state` class, which may be relevant for managing and updating the state of the input sources.

4. `Joystick.h`: This file likely contains the definition for the `Joystick_` class, which `DInputBackend` uses to interface with the joystick or gamepad device.

It is also possible that there are additional source files that implement the classes and functions declared in these header files.
