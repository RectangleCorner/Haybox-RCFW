Based on the provided code snippet, it seems that the file "ToughLoveArena.hpp" is being included and the class "ToughLoveArena" is defined. The constructor of the class initializes some private member variables and a dynamic array of objects of type "SocdPair". The "UpdateKeys" function updates the input state by pressing certain keys.

Therefore, I would guess that the relevant information in this file may pertain to the implementation of the "ToughLoveArena" class, its constructor, and the "UpdateKeys" function.
