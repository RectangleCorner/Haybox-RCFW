Based on the provided code snippet, it seems like this file is defining the `InputMode` class and its member functions. Here's a guess for the content of the other two files:

1. `socd.hpp`:
```cpp
#ifndef _SOC_D_HPP
#define _SOC_D_HPP

namespace socd {
    // Define the SocdPair class and its members
    class SocdPair {
      // ...
    };

    // Define the SocdState class and its members
    class SocdState {
      // ...
    };
}

#endif
```

2. `state.hpp`:
```cpp
#ifndef _STATE_HPP
#define _STATE_HPP

class InputState {
    // ...
};

#endif
```

In this case, `socd.hpp` might define classes related to a State of Charge Display (SOC-D), while `state.hpp` might define the `InputState` class used in the `InputMode` file. Please note that these are just guesses based on the provided code, and the actual content of the files may vary.
