Based on the code snippet provided, it appears to be a header file called "config_mode_selection.hpp" that defines functions related to selecting game modes for a controller and keyboard. It includes other header files such as "core/state.hpp" and several header files for different game modes, such as "modes/DefaultKeyboardMode.hpp" and "modes/Smash64.hpp". The header file also makes use of a variable called "current_kb_mode" and defines functions for setting the game mode for both the controller and keyboard. Overall, it seems to be part of a larger project related to configuring game modes for a controller and keyboard setup.
