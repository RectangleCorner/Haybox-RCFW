Based on the summary, the file `N64Backend.hpp` contains the declaration and definition of the `N64Backend` class. The file includes the headers `Nintendo.h` and `"comms/N64Backend.hpp"`. 

The class `N64Backend` is a subclass of `CommunicationBackend` and has a constructor that takes several arguments. It initializes a `CN64Console` object, `_n64`, with a given `data_pin` and sets `_data` to `defaultN64Data`. The constructor also calculates and sets the `_delay` based on the `polling_rate` argument.

The class has a destructor that deletes the `_n64` object.

The class has a member function `SendReport()` that updates inputs from sources, runs gamemode logic, and sets the values of digital and analog outputs in the `_data.report` structure. The outputs are then sent to the console using the `_n64->write(_data)` function, followed by a delay of `_delay` microseconds.
