Based on the code snippet provided, it appears to be an implementation of a keyboard driver using the Adafruit_TinyUSB library for an embedded system. 

The relevant files are:
1. "TUKeyboard.hpp" - This file likely contains the class declaration for the TUKeyboard class, which is the main class for the keyboard driver implementation.

Additionally, the following files are indirectly referenced:
2. "Adafruit_TinyUSB.h" - This library provides USB functionality for the embedded system.
3. "TUCompositeHID.hpp" - This file likely contains the class declaration for the TUCompositeHID class, which is used for composing multiple USB HID interfaces together.

These files should contain the necessary functions and data structures to implement the keyboard functionality, such as registering descriptors, handling key press events, and sending HID reports.

Please note that this is just a general guess based on the provided code snippet, and the actual file structure may vary depending on the specific implementation and library used.
