Based on the given code snippet, it appears to be a C++ header file that defines a class called `GamecubeBackend`. The class is a subclass of `CommunicationBackend` and provides functionality for communication with a Gamecube console.

The `GamecubeBackend` class has the following public member functions:
- `GamecubeBackend`: The constructor of the class that takes several parameters, including an array of input sources, the count of input sources, a data pin, and optional parameters for the PIO (Programmable Input/Output) configuration of the console. It initializes a `GamecubeConsole` object and sets the values of the member variables.
- `~GamecubeBackend`: The destructor of the class.
- `SendReport`: A function that sends a report.
- `GetOffset`: A function that returns the offset.

The private members of the class include a `_gamecube` object of type `GamecubeConsole` and a `_report` object of type `gc_report_t`.
