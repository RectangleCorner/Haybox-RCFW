This code appears to be defining a class called `ControllerMode` and implementing its member functions. It seems to be related to handling controller input and updating the output based on that input.

Based on the names of the functions and variables, it looks like the class `ControllerMode` is responsible for managing the directions and outputs of a controller. The `ResetDirections` function resets the directions to their default values. The `UpdateDirections` function calculates the directions based on the input from the left and right sticks of the controller, and updates the outputs accordingly.

The `UpdateOutputs` function seems to be a higher-level function that coordinates the overall update process, including handling any special modes of input (e.g. HandleSocd) and updating the digital and analog outputs.

Overall, this code seems to be part of a larger software system for handling controller input and generating corresponding output signals.
